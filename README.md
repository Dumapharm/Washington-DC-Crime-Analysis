# Washington DC Crime Analysis

## Project Description
This Project is a participation in a dataDNA dataset challenge which was organised by OnyxData for March, 2025. This dataset is focused on Washington DC crime.


## Introduction
With the increasing rate of crimes, crime analysis is pivotal to enhance security in Washington DC for the protection of lives and properties of residents, and prevention of crime. The analysis is aimed at identifying patterns of crime and severity, uncovering trends over time, pointing out geographical crime hotspots and efficiency of solving crimes in washington DC in order to help equip the law enforcement agency with vital information to boost their capacity to combat crimes.


## Objectives
The objectives of this project include the following;
- Total Crimes Reported – Number of crimes committed in a given time period.
- Crimes by Time of Day – Distribution of crimes by shift (Midnight, Day,Evening).
- Top 5 Crime Types – Most frequently occurring offenses. 
- Crime Severity Index – Weighting crimes based on UCR ranking toassess overall risk.
- Crime by Neighbourhood – Number of reported crimes per neighbourhood cluster.
- Hotspot Analysis – Geographical visualisation of crime density. 
- Weapon-Related Crimes – Percentage of crimes involving firearms. 
- Time to Resolution – Average duration from crime occurrence to report filing.
- Trends Over Time – Year-over-year or month-over-month crime trends.
- Crime Rate by Police District – Total crimes per district to assess law enforcement efficiency.
  

## Data Source
The dataset for the analysis was provided by OnyxData and it can be accessed -> [Washington DC Crime Dataset](https://github.com/Dumapharm/Washington-DC-Crime-Analysis/blob/2d5e55ddb9bb9886d17bbc7426475971937df59a/Onyx%20Data%20-DataDNA%20Dataset%20Challenge%20-%20Washington%20Crimes%20Dataset%20-%20March%202025.xlsx)


## Tool and Methodology
The tool I used for the analysis is Power BI.
I carried out the following procedures in process of cleaning and transforming the raw dataset;
- Removed duplicates
- Converted all columns to their right accurate data types
- Handling of missing values was done by deleting rows where the date of the crime committed was null and filled the null values of the districts with the District which has the highest frequency of crime.
  

## Analysis
The Key Performance Indicators of the analysis are;
1. Total Crimes
2. Resolved Crimes
3. Average Resolution Time

The analysis consists of three dashboards as shown below;

The Locations dashboard depicts the geographical hotspots of crimes in Washington DC and resolved crimes in different Districts.


## Key Insights

1. The highest occurring crime type was theft/other and most of the crimes were committed using other method.
2. District 2 has the highest risk for theft/other. Neighborhood cluster 2 and District 5 had the highest occurrence of crime. District 2 has the highest rate of crime resolution while District 7 has the least rate of resolved cases.
3. Crime incidents surged through the weekdays, peaking on Friday while most of the crimes were committed in the evening shift and in the year 2025. 
4. Arson has the least resolution time while homicide had the highest resolution time.
5. The state center had the most concentration of crime and of all the identified hotspots.
   

## Recommendations

1. Law enforcement agencies should educate the residents on how to safeguard their properties against theft and report any suspicious activities to relevant authorities while the State should pass stringent laws against any unauthorize use of other method since it plays a crucial rolecontributes some in execution of crime activities.
2. More resources and equipment should be deployed to Neighborhood cluster 2, and Districts 5 and 7 in order to curb crime activities.
3. Since evening is the peak of crime, there should be increase in patrol of security personnel in the evening shift.
4. Forensic technology should be employed in investigation of homicide in order to reduce the average resolution time.
5. The law enforcement agencies in the Districts (1, 2, 5 and 6) covering the state center should collaborate in intelligence gathering and sharing, as this will help to detect crime, enhance quick response as this will play a crucial in the prevention of crimes.
   

## Conclusion

The Washington DC Crime Analysis has generated some important insights from the crime pattern within the state, highlighted some specific areas of concern and generated actionable information for improving security situation of the state. This was done using data analysis techniques and visualization, and uncovered trend(s) of crime, such as prevalence of theft, widespread used of other method to commit crime which occur mostly in the evening shift and fridays having the peak time for crime activities. Furthermore, the hostpots with the highest rate of crimes are Neighborhood cluster 2, and Dsitricts 5 and 7.

The analysis highlights targeted interventions including increased presence of law enforcement agencies in areas where crime rates is very high, deploying additional resources to reduce high resolution time for homicide. Furthermore, there should be collobration and intelligence sharing between law enforcement agencies for different Districts which will be crucial for effective crime detection and prevention, particurlarly in the center of Washington DC.

This analysis provides a basis for informed decision-making, offering recommendations to reduce crime and improve the efficiency of law enforcement agencies in Washington DC.
